Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?‚Äù
Answer: I really wanted to get into the Dare IT challenge 
because I like testing, I like to learn something new. 
I hoped to gain new knowledge, experience, 
find a job in this area. and of course, to meet and make friends with 
people who want the same. 

 I wish you all a pleasant and good study!
